      <h3>My favorite celebrity is Dom Cobb</h3>
      <p>Yes, I know that technically, he's not a celebrity. He's a character. But Inception is my favorite movie, so I'd like to consider it a reality. According to Inception fan wiki, his bio states: "Dominick "Dom" Cobb[1] is the main protagonist of the film, Inception. Cobb is well known in the black market because of his level of expertise in the field of extraction, which consists of stealing his mark's ideas by infiltrating their dreams and stealing valuable information from them. Wanted as a fugitive for being falsely implicated for the death of his wife, Mal, Cobb is unable to return to his home. As a totem, he uses a spinning top that was once owned by Mal." </p>
